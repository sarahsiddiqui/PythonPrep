# PythonPrep

I initially started practicing python and learned the language through my grade 11 python programming course. The course's difficulty increased with time, beginning with extreme basics so that students got the hang of coding and proceeding coding a complete game. We were taught the basics of core python and with each assingment and homework module, necessary skills for a programmer were learnt, such as analytical and independent-learning skills.
